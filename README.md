Iris Flower Classification – Task 1

This project is part of my Data Science Internship. It uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Project Objectives

Load and explore the Iris dataset

Train a machine learning classification model using Scikit-learn

Predict flower species based on sepal and petal measurements

Evaluate the model’s performance using test data

Understand the basics of supervised classification in machine learning

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Key Learnings

Data preprocessing and splitting into train/test sets

Building and training classification models

Evaluating accuracy and performance# CodeAlpha-Internship-Task1
